# Chess Engine

An attempt to build a chess engine using reinforcement based learning.

The idea is simple:

1. Let the computer play some random games.
2. Train a neural network.
3. Let the computer play more games using the neural network to predict moves.
4. Retrain the neural network with the new results.
5. Go to 3.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo.
2. `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. `node index.js` to run.
